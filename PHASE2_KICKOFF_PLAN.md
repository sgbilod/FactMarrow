# Phase 2 Kickoff Plan - Document Processing & Analysis

**Date:** October 24, 2025
**Status:** ✅ Kickoff Initiated - Agent Integration Pending
**Confidence Level:** 95%+

---

## Overview

Phase 2 focuses on Document Processing & Multi-Agent Analysis. The system ingests documents, extracts claims, verifies facts against authoritative sources, and generates comprehensive analysis reports.

---

## Phase 2 Objectives

1. Submit test COVID vaccine claim document through analysis pipeline
2. Verify 6-agent workflow coordination and inter-agent communication
3. Extract claims and populate claims database table
4. Verify facts against external sources using MCP servers
5. Generate confidence-scored analysis report
6. Store results in PostgreSQL and vector database

---

## 6-Agent Orchestration Architecture

```
Input Document
      ↓
[ROOT COORDINATOR] - Master orchestration
      ├→ [DOCUMENT PROCESSOR] - Parse & structure content
      ├→ [FACT EXTRACTOR] - Extract quantifiable claims
      ├→ [VERIFICATION SPECIALIST] - Verify against sources
      ├→ [REPORT WRITER] - Generate analysis report
      └→ [QUALITY REVIEWER] - QA & confidence scoring
      ↓
Output: Comprehensive Analysis Report with Confidence Ratings
      ↓
Storage: PostgreSQL + Chroma Vector DB
```

## Test Document

- **File:** data/documents/test_covid_claim.txt
- **Content:** WHO/Lancet study on COVID vaccine efficacy
- **Size:** 408 bytes
- **Status:** Submitted to API (HTTP 200 OK)

---

## Expected Claims to Extract

1. COVID vaccines prevented >1M deaths in 2021
2. Half of lives saved in low/middle-income countries
3. WHO-coordinated study across 185 countries
4. Research published in Lancet
5. Without vaccines, 1.4M additional deaths

### Phase 2B: Agent Workflow (PENDING)

**Status:** ❌ Not Yet Implemented
- Document storage to DB
- Cagent framework initialization
- MCP server connections
- Root coordinator activation
- 6-agent execution pipeline

### Phase 2C: Output Validation (PENDING)

**Status:** ❌ Awaiting completion

---

## Success Criteria

- [x] Infrastructure operational
- [x] Configuration validated
- [x] Test document prepared
- [ ] Agent orchestration implemented
- [ ] Document analysis workflow executed
- [ ] All 5 database tables populated
- [ ] Vector embeddings created
- [ ] Confidence scores assigned

---

## Next Steps

1. **Immediate (15-30 min):** Implement Cagent integration layer
2. **Short-term (1-2 hours):** Complete agent orchestration and test
3. **Medium-term (2-4 hours):** Generate Phase 2 completion report
