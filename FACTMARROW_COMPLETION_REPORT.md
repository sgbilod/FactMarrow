## Critical Success Factors

1. **Use Docker Cagent** - No code needed, YAML configuration only
2. **Leverage MCP Protocol** - 50+ pre-built integrations ready
3. **Stay Local First** - Process documents on your machine initially
4. **Use Your Subscriptions** - Don't purchase anything new
5. **Test Early** - Run analysis on sample documents before scaling
6. **Document Everything** - GitHub becomes your knowledge base
